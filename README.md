## Evaluating AI-Assisted Pollinator Detection in Agricultural Fields  
This is the official repository for the paper "Evaluating AI-Assisted Pollinator Detection in Agricultural Fields".

## Paper Highlights
* We introduced an AI-assisted annotation framework for pollinator detection datasets.
* Our annotation framework increased the annotations by 87% compared to manual labels.
* Training with our dataset increased model performance of 29% mAP.
* With our dataset, we examined how different treatments impact model performance.
* We showed that increasing the number of annotated pollinators improves model performance.
